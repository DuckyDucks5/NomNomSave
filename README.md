# 🍱 NomNomSave

**NomNomSave** is a mobile application designed to help users manage and track the expiration dates of their food and household products — reducing waste, saving money, and improving everyday organization.

## 📱 About the Project

We've all experienced it: discovering expired groceries at the back of the fridge or pantry and realizing they were long forgotten. NomNomSave was built to solve this problem.

With a simple manual-entry system, users can add items, set expiration dates, and categorize them for easy tracking — all from their mobile device.

This project was developed as part of a university group assignment, focused on combining practical solutions with thoughtful design and agile team collaboration.
